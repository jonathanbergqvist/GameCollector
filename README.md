# GameCollector
This is my own software to collect games in a single spot, written in Java.

The software requires a download and import as external library of Apache Commons IO from http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/download_io.cgi to work!

The current services available in the program is Steam, Origin and Uplay.
